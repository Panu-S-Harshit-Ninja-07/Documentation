# Purpose 

This document will explore some of the popular tools that can help you enable GitOps workflow in your application environment by automating the testing and deployment of IaC codes.

***

## This document includes evaluation of GitOps tools:
Multiple GitOps tools come with different features and may not cover all GitOps needs. Still, we recommend trying out these  popular GitOps tools:-
* ArgoCD 
* FluxCD
* Jenkins X
* BuildPiper

Argo CD is a declarative, GitOps continuous delivery tool for Kubernetes,responsible for continuously monitoring all running applications and comparing their live state to the desired state specified in the Git repository.

# FluxCD

Flux CD is a Continuous Delivery tool to help keep Kubernetes clusters in sync with configuration sources such as Git repositories and automate configuration updates when available. Flux is built with the GitOps toolkit and supports multi-tenancy and syncing an arbitrary number of Git repositories.


# Jenkins X

Jenkins X automates and accelerates Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery for developers on the cloud, so they can focus on building software,The entire Jenkins X experience is based around Git. The installation, extensions and applications you develop are managed via a cluster Git repository which is the desired state of your Kubernetes cluster.

# BuildPiper
