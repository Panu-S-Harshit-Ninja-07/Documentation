# Purpose 

This document will explore some of the popular tools that can help you enable GitOps workflow in your application environment by automating the testing and deployment of IaC codes.


***

## This document includes evaluation of GitOps tools:
Multiple GitOps tools come with different features and may not cover all GitOps needs. Still, we recommend trying out these  popular GitOps tools:-
* ArgoCD 
* FluxCD
* Jenkins X
* BuildPiper

Argo CD is a declarative, GitOps continuous delivery tool for Kubernetes,responsible for continuously monitoring all running applications and comparing their live state to the desired state specified in the Git repository.

# FluxCD

Flux CD is a Continuous Delivery tool to help keep Kubernetes clusters in sync with configuration sources such as Git repositories and automate configuration updates when available. Flux is built with the GitOps toolkit and supports multi-tenancy and syncing an arbitrary number of Git repositories.


# Jenkins X

Jenkins X automates and accelerates Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery for developers on the cloud, so they can focus on building software,The entire Jenkins X experience is based around Git. The installation, extensions and applications you develop are managed via a cluster Git repository which is the desired state of your Kubernetes cluster.

# BuildPiper

# Conclusion

The choice between ArgoCD, FluxCD, Jenkins X, and Buildpiper depends on your specific needs and preferences. Here's a general guideline:

* **ArgoCD:** Ideal for continuous deployment in Kubernetes environments with a focus on declarative GitOps principles.

* **FluxCD:** Suitable for managing GitOps workflows in Kubernetes and provides good support for continuous delivery.

* **Jenkins X:** Well-suited for comprehensive CI/CD and GitOps in Kubernetes, offering a broad range of features and good extensibility.

* **Buildpiper:** If your primary focus is on reproducibility and you prefer a Docker-based approach with Kubernetes support.

Ultimately, the "best" tool depends on your project requirements, team expertise, and the specific workflows you want to implement. Evaluate each tool based on your needs, and consider factors such as community support, documentation, and extensibility for a well-informed decision.
