# Drawbacks
* BitBucket doesn’t have the same simplified PR management tools as other competitors.
* The private repositories are free for a team of 1 to 5 members. If the team is larger than 5, you have to pay for each additional team member.
* Sometimes integrated applications like SourceTree perform strange errors, causing loss of time.
* Bitbucket does not capture the details about the force push. There should be some way to capture the details of force push as force push deletes the history.
* There are some search-related issues when finding a particular file. First, you need to launch the repository and find it locally. It’s a bit long process.
