# Introduction
Branching strategies play a crucial role in the development lifecycle, offering a structured approach to collaboration and code management. In this document, we explored various branching strategies, their types, considerations for choosing a strategy, comparisons, and recommendations for usage.

# Types of Branching Strategy
* **Feature Branch Flow:** Feature Branching allows developers to work on isolated features, ensuring a clean and organized development process. It promotes parallel 
    development and facilitates feature testing before integration into the main branch.
  
* **Git Flow:** Git Flow introduces a more complex branching model with separate branches for features, releases, and hotfixes. It is suitable for projects with regular 
    releases and a need for strict version control.

* **GitLab Flow:** GitLab Flow emphasizes continuous delivery by reducing the number of branches. It simplifies the process, making it suitable for projects that require 
    quick and frequent releases.

* **Env Branch Flow:** Environment Branching involves creating branches corresponding to different environments, such as development, testing, staging, and production. It 
    ensures a clear separation of code for various stages of the deployment pipeline.     

# How to Choose a Branching Strategy
Choosing the right branching strategy depends on various factors:

* **Project Size and Complexity:** Larger projects may benefit from more structured approaches like Git Flow, while smaller projects may find Feature Branching or GitLab 
    Flow more suitable.

* **Release Frequency:** Projects with frequent releases may opt for GitLab Flow, while those with scheduled releases can consider Git Flow.

* **Team Size and Structure:** Feature Branching may be ideal for smaller teams, whereas Git Flow or GitLab Flow can provide more structure for larger teams.

* **Deployment Pipeline:** Consider how the code progresses through different environments and choose a strategy that aligns with your deployment pipeline.

# Comparison

| Branching Strategy | Advantages                            | Drawbacks | Focus            |
| ------             | ----------                            | ----------| ---------------- |
| Feature Branching	 | Isolation of features                 | May lead to longer integration periods       | Individual feature development and testing |
| Git Flow           | Structured approach                   | Complexity increases with the project size   | Well-defined branching model for releases |
| GitLab Flow        | Emphasis on continuous delivery       | May be less suitable for smaller projects    | Streamlined pipeline for continuous delivery |
| Env Branching      | Environment-specific code management  | Might end up with lots of branches           | Managing code changes based on environments|

This table provides a concise comparison of the mentioned branching strategies, highlighting their respective advantages, drawbacks, and primary focus. The choice among these strategies should be based on the specific needs and characteristics of the project at hand.

# When to Use Each Strategy
* **Feature Branch Flow:** Ideal for projects where parallel development and feature isolation are critical.

* **Git Flow:** Suited for projects with regular releases and a need for strict version control.

* **GitLab Flow:** Recommended for projects with frequent releases and a focus on continuous delivery.

* **Environment Branch Flow:** Useful for projects with a clear separation of environments in the deployment pipeline.

# Conclusion
The strategy you choose will depend on your team and the nature and complexity of your project and so this should be evaluated on a case-by-case basis. Here, in this case we are proceeding with the Feature Workflow Strategy according to our team & use case.

The Feature Branch Workflow is a versatile strategy suitable for projects of various sizes and complexities. Its emphasis on collaboration, isolation, and systematic testing makes it an excellent choice for teams aiming for organized and controlled feature development. The workflow accommodates different development paces and provides a structured approach to managing releases. Code reviews are efficient and focused, contributing to overall code quality. By maintaining a stable main branch, the Feature Branch Workflow supports a consistent and reliable code base.
