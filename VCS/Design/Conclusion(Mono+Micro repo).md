## Purpose
## Introduction 

  A repo (short for repository) is a storage for all the changes and files from a project, enabling developers to “version control” the project’s assets throughout its development stage.
### Mono Repo
  A monorepo stores all your application and microservice code in a single source code repository like Git. A mono repo with unified and automated build and deploy pipelines can mitigate many development issues. 
  
  Using a mono repo, it’s easier to standardize code and tooling across the teams. The single view of the whole code available in a mono repo increases the discoverability of status and changes. This results in smoother release management and easier refactoring.
### Monorepo-style development is a software development approach where:

- You develop multiple projects in the same repository.
- The projects can depend on each other, so they can share code.
- When you make a change, you do not rebuild or retest every project in the monorepo. Instead, you only rebuild and retest the projects that can be affected by your change.

### Micro Repo

## Comparison

## Conclusion 

In conclusion, a monorepo offers advantages like improved visibility, code sharing, and standardized practices for managing microservices. However, challenges include slower development cycles and potential complexities. To optimize monorepo usage, consider best practices such as selective builds, effective dependency management, and trunk-based development. The decision to adopt a monorepo should be based on a careful evaluation of specific needs and a balanced consideration of its benefits and challenges. Successful implementation requires a thoughtful approach and collaboration within the development team.
