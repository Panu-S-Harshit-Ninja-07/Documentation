## Introduction 

Commit hooks are scripts that run automatically before or after specific events in the Git lifecycle. They help maintain code quality, enforce coding standards, and prevent undesirable changes from being committed.

***

## Setting Up Commit Hooks  

To set up commit hooks, follow these general steps:

* Navigate to the root directory of your Git repository.
* Create a new directory named .git/hooks if it doesn't exist.
* Inside the .git/hooks directory, create or copy the hook scripts.
* Make sure the scripts are executable (chmod +x script-name).

*** 

## Recommended Commit Hooks

### 1. Pre-Commit Hook
**Purpose:** Runs before a commit is created. It's ideal for checking syntax, running quick tests, and ensuring the commit won't break the build.

**Implementation:** Create a script (e.g., pre-commit) that performs necessary checks. Examples include running linting tools, checking for debug statements, or validating coding standards.

### 2. Commit Message Format Hook
**Purpose:** Ensures commit messages follow a standardized format. Consistent commit messages enhance readability and traceability.

**Implementation:** Use a script (e.g., commit-msg) to check the commit message format. Consider using tools like commitlint or regex patterns to enforce conventions.

### 3. Pre-Push Hook
**Purpose:** Runs before a push to the remote repository. It's suitable for running more comprehensive tests, ensuring code quality before changes are shared.

**Implementation:** Create a script (e.g., pre-push) that runs unit tests, integration tests, and other relevant checks before allowing a push.

### 4. Code Linting Hook
**Purpose:** Enforces coding standards and identifies common programming errors early in the development process.

**Implementation:** Integrate a linter (e.g., ESLint for JavaScript, Flake8 for Python) into a script (e.g., lint) to analyze code for style and syntax issues.

### 5. Unit Testing Hook
**Purpose:** Ensures that new code changes do not break existing unit tests.

**Implementation:** Create a script (e.g., run-tests) that runs the project's unit tests. Failing tests should prevent the commit from being created.

### 6. Security Scanning Hook
**Purpose:** Scans code for known vulnerabilities and security issues.

**Implementation:** Integrate a security scanning tool (e.g., Snyk, SonarQube) into a script (e.g., security-scan) to identify and prevent the introduction of security vulnerabilities.

## Customizing Commit Hooks

Commit hooks can be customized based on project requirements. Modify the scripts or integrate additional tools as needed. Consider adding comments to explain the purpose and usage of each hook.

***

## Troubleshooting
If hooks are not working as expected, check the following:

* Ensure scripts are executable (chmod +x script-name).
* Verify that the hooks are in the correct .git/hooks directory.
* Check for error messages in the console or terminal.

***

## Conclusion

Implementing these commit hooks helps maintain code quality, consistency, and security throughout the development process. Regularly update and refine the hooks based on the evolving needs of the project.
