GitHub is a web-based platform and version control system that plays a crucial role in modern software development. It provides a collaborative environment for developers to host, manage, and share their code repositories. 

Agenda 
-------
 1. Version Control 
GitHub serves as a distributed version control system, built on top of Git. It allows developers to track changes in their code, collaborate on projects, and manage different versions of their software.

2. Repository Hosting
GitHub provides a platform for hosting code repositories. Developers can create repositories to store and organize their project files, making it easy to manage and share code with others.

3. Collaboration
GitHub facilitates collaboration among developers. Multiple contributors can work on the same project simultaneously by cloning repositories, creating branches, and merging changes.

4. Branching and Merging
GitHub supports branching, enabling developers to work on isolated features or bug fixes in separate branches. Changes made in these branches can be merged back into the main codebase when ready.
