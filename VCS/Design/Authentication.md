# Introduction
To keep account secure, one must authenticate before they can access resources on GitHub. When anyone authenticate to GitHub, they supply or confirm credentials that are unique to them to prove that they are exactly who they declare to be using different credentials depending on where they authenticate.

You can access your resources in GitHub in a variety of ways: in the browser, via GitHub Desktop or another desktop application, with the API, or via the command line. Each way of accessing GitHub supports different modes of authentication.

* Username and password with two-factor authentication, or a passkey
* Personal access token
* SSH key

# Authentication Methods











**Authentication in Browser**

| Method | Description  |
| ---- | ------------- |
| Username and password only  | If you have not enabled 2FA, GitHub will ask for additional verification when you first sign in from an unrecognized device, such as a new browser profile, a browser where the cookies have been deleted, or a new computer. |
| Two-factor authentication (2FA) | After you successfully enter your username and password, we'll also prompt you to provide a code that's generated by a time-based one time password (TOTP) application on your mobile device or sent as a text message (SMS). |
| Passkey (opt-in beta) | Passkeys satisfy both password and 2FA requirements, so you can complete your sign in with a single step. |
| SAML single sign-on | Before you can access resources owned by an organization or enterprise account that uses SAML single sign-on. |
| Session cookies | GitHub typically marks a user session for deletion after two weeks of inactivity. |

**Authenticating with the API**

| Method | Description  |
| ---- | ------------- |
| Authenticating to the API with a personal access token | If you want to use the GitHub REST API for personal use, you can create a personal access token. If possible, GitHub recommends that you use a fine-grained personal access token instead of a personal access token (classic). |
| Authenticating to the API with an app | If you want to use the API on behalf of an organization or another user, GitHub recommends that you use a GitHub App. You can also create an OAuth token with an OAuth app to access the REST API. |
| Authenticating to the API in a GitHub Actions workflow | If you want to use the API in a GitHub Actions workflow, GitHub recommends that you authenticate with the built-in GITHUB_TOKEN instead of creating a token. You can grant permissions to the GITHUB_TOKEN with the permissions key. |

**Authenticating with the command line**

| Method | Description  |
| ---- | ------------- |
| HTTPS | With GitHub CLI, one can either authenticate with a personal access token or via the web browser. |
| SSH | With GitHub CLI, the CLI will find SSH public keys on machine and will prompt to select one for upload. If GitHub CLI does not find a SSH public key for upload, it can generate a new SSH public/private keypair and upload the public key to account on GitHub.com. |
| Authorizing for SAML single sign-on | To use a personal access token or SSH key to access resources owned by an organization that uses SAML single sign-on, one must also authorize the personal token or SSH key. |
