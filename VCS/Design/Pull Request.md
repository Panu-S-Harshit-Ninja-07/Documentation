# Introduction 
A pull request (PR) is a fundamental aspect of collaborative development on GitHub. It allows contributors to propose changes to a repository and initiate a discussion around those changes before merging them into the main codebase.

# Creating a Pull Request
### **Step 1: Fork the Repository** 
Forking creates a personal copy of the repository on your GitHub account. It allows you to make changes without affecting the original project. Click the `Fork` button on the top right of the repository page to create your own fork.

***
### **Step 2: Clone the Forked Repository**
Use the git clone command with the URL of your forked repository to download a local copy. This copy is where you'll make and test your changes.

***
### **Step 3: Create a Branch**
Branches isolate changes from the main codebase. Use `git checkout -b branch-name` to create and switch to a new branch. Naming your branch appropriately helps others understand the purpose of your changes.


***
### **Step 4: Make Changes**
Make necessary code or documentation modifications in your local branch. Ensure your changes align with the purpose of your contribution, whether it's fixing a bug or adding a new feature.


***
### **Step 5: Commit Changes**
Commits save changes with a message describing what was done. Use `git commit -m "your message"` to commit changes. Clear and concise commit messages help collaborators understand your intentions.


***
### **Step 6: Push Changes**
Pushing uploads your local branch and commits to your forked repository on GitHub. Execute `git push origin branch-name` to push changes. This makes your modifications accessible for creating a pull request.


***
### **Step 7: Create Pull Request**
A pull request proposes changes to the original repository. Navigate to the original repository, click `New Pull Request`, select your branch, and follow the prompts. Write a clear title and description to help reviewers understand the purpose of your contribution.
