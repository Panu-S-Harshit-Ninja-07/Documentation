# Why

| Key Aspect      | Description                                                                                                                                                               |
|-----------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Simplicity      | GitLab flow is relatively simple to learn and implement, even for teams new to Git. It uses only a few core branches (master, develop, feature branches, and release branches) and well-defined workflows for branching, merging, and deployment. |
| Transparency    | GitLab flow emphasizes transparency by linking code changes to issues in the issue tracker. This helps team members understand the context of changes and track the progress of work.                                 |
| Efficiency      | GitLab flow promotes efficient development by encouraging small, focused feature branches that can be merged frequently. This reduces the risk of merge conflicts and makes it easier to identify and fix bugs.                |
| Integration     | GitLab flow is designed to work seamlessly with GitLab's features, such as merge requests, continuous integration/continuous delivery (CI/CD), and issue tracking. This integration can help to automate tasks and streamline the development process. |
| Flexibility     | While GitLab flow provides a basic framework, it is also flexible enough to be adapted to meet the specific needs of your team. You can add additional branches or workflows as needed to accommodate your project's complexity.         |

| Branch Type                  | Description                                                                                                     |
|------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Main Branch**              | The central branch representing the latest deployable code. Developers merge their feature branches into main after thorough testing and code review. |
| **Feature Branches**         | Short-lived branches created by developers to work on specific features or bug fixes. Once complete, they are merged into main. |
| **Environment Branches**     | Additional branches representing different deployment environments (e.g., staging or production). Created from main and used for further testing or configuration before deploying to production. (Optional) |


| Workflow Step                                       | Description                                                                                                     |
|-----------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Developers create feature branches from main.      | -                                                                                                               |
| Changes are committed to the feature branch.        | Descriptive messages accompany each commit.                                                                     |
| Code reviews are conducted on the feature branch.   | Ensures quality and adherence to standards.                                                                      |
| Upon approval, the feature branch is merged into main. | -                                                                                                               |
| CI/CD pipelines are triggered, running tests and building artifacts. | Automated processes ensure code integrity.                                                                    |
| For environment branches, main is merged into the desired environment branch (e.g., staging). | Allows further testing or configuration before deploying to production. (Optional)                            |
| Additional testing or configuration can be performed in the staging environment. | -                                                                                                               |
| Once ready, the code from the environment branch is merged into production. | -                                                                                                               |
| The production deployment takes place, making the new features or bug fixes available to users. | -                                                                                                               |

# Disadvantage of GitLab flow

| Key Concern                | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
|----------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Potential Merge Complexity | Can become cumbersome for larger teams with frequent merges, increasing the risk of merge conflicts and requiring more attention to conflict resolution.                                                                                   |
| Feature Branch Longevity   | Feature branches often live longer than other workflows, potentially leading to outdated code or divergence from main if not actively managed.                                                                                           |
| Release Management (Optional)| Requires additional overhead if using separate production branches for controlled releases, adding another layer of complexity.                                                                                                              |
| Learning Curve             | While simpler than GitFlow, GitLab Flow still has a learning curve, especially for teams new to Git branching strategies.                                                                                                                  |
| Dependency on CI/CD        | Optimal execution relies heavily on robust CI/CD pipelines for automated testing and deployment, which might not be available for all teams.                                                                                               |
