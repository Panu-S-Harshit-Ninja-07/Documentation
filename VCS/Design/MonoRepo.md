## Introduction 

  A repo (short for repository) is a storage for all the changes and files from a project, enabling developers to “version control” the project’s assets throughout its development stage.

  A monorepo stores all your application and microservice code in a single source code repository like Git. A mono repo with unified and automated build and deploy pipelines can mitigate many development issues. 
  
  Using a mono repo, it’s easier to standardize code and tooling across the teams. The single view of the whole code available in a mono repo increases the discoverability of status and changes. This results in smoother release management and easier refactoring.

### Monorepo-style development is a software development approach where:

- You develop multiple projects in the same repository.
- The projects can depend on each other, so they can share code.
- When you make a change, you do not rebuild or retest every project in the monorepo. Instead, you only rebuild and retest the projects that can be affected by your change.

## Features 

Single source of truth: A monorepo provides a single place to store all configurations and tests.
Easier to share code: A monorepo allows for code reuse with shared packages while keeping them isolated.
Easier to refactor code: A monorepo provides a single view of the entire code, making it easier to refactor.
Fewer barriers: A monorepo can result in fewer barriers in the software development lifecycle. This can lead to faster feedback loops and less time looking for code.
Easier to standardize code: A monorepo can make it easier to standardize code and tooling across teams.
Easier to manage dependencies: A monorepo can reduce the overhead from managing dependencies.
Easier to organize projects: A monorepo allows projects to be organized and grouped logically.
