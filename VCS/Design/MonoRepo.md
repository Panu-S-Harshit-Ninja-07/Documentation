## Introduction 

  A repo (short for repository) is a storage for all the changes and files from a project, enabling developers to “version control” the project’s assets throughout its development stage.

  A single, monolithic repository, also known as a monorepo, stores all your application and microservice code in a single source code repository like Git. A mono repo with unified and automated build and deploy pipelines can mitigate many development issues. 
  
  Advantages like easy visibility and code sharing can improve collaboration. Using a mono repo, it’s easier to standardize code and tooling across the teams. The single view of the whole code available in a mono repo increases the discoverability of status and changes. This results in smoother release management and easier refactoring.

## Why

Visibility
With a monorepo, there is more accountability since many projects are visible to many people and monorepos lend themselves to security features.

Collaboration
A single repository makes it easier to collaborate. That’s because everyone can access the code, files, and assets. So, developers can share and reuse assets.

Speed
Using a single repository can help you accelerate development. For instance, you can make atomic changes (one action to make a change across multiple projects).

## Features 

Single source of truth: A monorepo provides a single place to store all configurations and tests.
Easier to share code: A monorepo allows for code reuse with shared packages while keeping them isolated.
Easier to refactor code: A monorepo provides a single view of the entire code, making it easier to refactor.
Fewer barriers: A monorepo can result in fewer barriers in the software development lifecycle. This can lead to faster feedback loops and less time looking for code.
Easier to standardize code: A monorepo can make it easier to standardize code and tooling across teams.
Easier to manage dependencies: A monorepo can reduce the overhead from managing dependencies.
Easier to organize projects: A monorepo allows projects to be organized and grouped logically.
