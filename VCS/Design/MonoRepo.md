## Introduction 

A single, monolithic repository, also known as a monorepo, stores all your application and microservice code in a single source code repository like Git. A monorepo with unified and automated build and deploy pipelines can mitigate many development issues. 
Advantages like easy visibility and code sharing can improve collaboration. Using a monorepo, it’s easier to standardize code and tooling across the teams. The single view of the whole code available in a monorepo increases discoverability of status and changes. This results in smoother release management and easier refactoring.

This monorepo code typically has a single build pipeline that produces the application executable. Many teams split the code of various app components into subfolders and use Git workflow for new features or bug fixes. This approach is natural for most applications or systems developed using a monolithic architecture. Though maintenance is straightforward, this method reduces overall velocity because it’s possible for just a few difficult-to-fix bugs to prevent deployment of release candidates to production.

This article outlines the differences between monorepos and polyrepos, weighs the pros and cons of monorepos, and helps you determine whether a monorepo is the best choice for your team.
