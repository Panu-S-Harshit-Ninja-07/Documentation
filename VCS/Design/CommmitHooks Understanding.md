## Introduction

Commit hooks in Git are scripts that run automatically before or after specific Git events, such as committing changes. They allow developers to enforce and automate certain tasks, ensuring code quality, adherence to standards, and consistency throughout the development process.

## Purpose of hook

| **Purpose** | **Description** |
| ----------- | --------------- |
| **Code Quality Assurance** | Enforce coding standards, run linting, or perform static code analysis before allowing commits. |
| **Preventing Sensitive Data** | Check for and prevent the inclusion of sensitive information like passwords or API keys in commits. |
| **Automating Tests** | Run automated tests to ensure that new changes do not introduce issues. |
| **Enforcing Commit Message Guidelines** | Ensure that commit messages follow a predefined format or include relevant information. |

## Why in our project

Using commit hooks in your project offers several advantages that contribute to the overall efficiency, quality, and consistency of the development process. Here are some key reasons for incorporating commit hooks into your project:
| **Code Quality Assurance** | Commit hooks enable automated checks for coding standards, syntax errors, and other code quality metrics. This ensures that the committed code meets predefined standards, enhancing overall code quality. |
| **Enforcement of Best Practices** | Commit hooks can enforce best practices such as proper commit message formatting, ensuring that contributors provide meaningful and standardized descriptions for each commit. |
| **Consistency Across Contributors** | Commit hooks establish a consistent development environment for all contributors by enforcing the same set of rules and checks. This consistency is especially valuable in collaborative projects with multiple developers. |
| **Streamlined Development Workflow** | Commit hooks automate repetitive tasks, allowing developers to focus on coding rather than manual checks. This streamlines the development workflow and reduces the likelihood of human error. |
| **Integration with CI/CD Pipelines** | Commit hooks complement continuous integration/continuous deployment (CI/CD) pipelines by performing preliminary checks before changes are integrated into the shared repository. This integration ensures a smoother overall development pipeline. |
| **Improved Collaboration** | By enforcing consistent commit message standards, commit hooks enhance collaboration among team members. Clear and well-documented commit messages improve code review processes and make it easier to understand the history of changes. |
